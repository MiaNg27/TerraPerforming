Extractivist Choreographies: Performative AI for Environmental Justice is a cross-disciplinary research and artistic project that employs choreographic practices and Machine Learning (ML) models, for finding a novel way of discussing the impact of Extractivism in the form of a performance. We are forming a performing platform based on change detection visualisations of extractive landscapes . We select the classical Indian dance form, Bharatanatyam, to be the movement language in question; its rich storytelling practice is offering a fertile ground for experimentation with Artificial Intelligence (AI) on meanings and gestural vocabulary. In this project we isolate and employ the concepts of “mudras” and “adavus” found in Bharatanatyam as the language to communicate with kinetic activities of extractive machines through ML model for a visual and performative articulation of the discourse on Extractivism. By being critical and self-critical on the use of technology, we are scientifically interested in the environmental cost of computations for intelligent performance making, as well as highlighting the cultural repercussions of extractivist landscapes. By focusing on indigenous peoples of the Global South, we are inquiring practices that are adaptive to the environment, to inform our movement investigation.¹
